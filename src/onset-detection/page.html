<h2>Motivation</h2>

  If you want to learn about onset detection or beat tracking, you will find
  lots of papers, but little code. Then you will start finding references to a
  blog series by Bad Logic games. The website is gone but you can find the
  articles in the wayback machine. Most of the saves are missing the images.
  Here are the best saves of the two most important articles I've found:

    >Onset Detection Part 6: Onsets &amp; Spectral Flux</a
  >
  and

    >Onset Detection Part 7: Thresholding &amp; Peak picking</a
  >
</p>

<p>
  The articles use Python. It's probably python2 since it was written in 2010.
  That's fine. Now Web Audio exists. It would be fun to do it in the browser.
</p>

<p>
  Anyways I need onset detection and beat tracking for other things I'm working
  on. Might as well write it down and save this information for future
  generations.

<h2>What is an onset?</h2>

  An onset is the beginning of a note. Above is a recoding of a single guitar
  note. The onset is the tall part on the left. It's actually kind of hard for
  the computer to find onsets in music. They have

  about it.

<h2>Lets look at the Fourier Transform of the audio</h2>
Actually lets look at a sample with more onsets in it first. This is some wub
wub I heard in a game my kids playing.

<div>
  <canvas id="canvas-2" ></canvas>
  <input type="button" id="play-2" value="play" />
</div>

<div>
  <canvas id="canvas-3" ></canvas>
</div>
<p>You can kind of see the beats in there.</p>
<p>Y axis is frequency; Color is magnitude.</p>
<p>X is time. The sample is split into chunks of 1024 samples.</p>
